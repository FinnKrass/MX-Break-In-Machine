## Bill of Materials (Hardware)

There are two documents which outline all components needed in order to make sourcing easier than finding links throughout all of the docs. Links provided here will be for AliExpress (and Taobao where applicable) for the machine itself, and another document is dedicated to components from mouser for the PCB<sup>*</sup>. I wanted to make sourcing as easy as possible, so you should be able to order all of the components you need from just two locations (or one if you're skipping the PCB).

<sub>*The SDB628 and OLED for the PCB are listed here in order to keep all AliExpress links in one place</sub>

### Hardware

AliExpress Choice options have been added where applicable as well, this should speed up shipping and remove some uncertainty. Use these links for speed, non choice options may be cheaper, or just shops that I have experience ordering from. <u>***Please be sure to select the correct options from the links provided.***</u>

### Fasteners

M3 and M2 kits can be found [here](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/1005005999729125.html) if you don't have any on hand, many of these screws are common in keyboards so some may already own kits like these. The M3x6 grub screw can be found [here](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/1005003125436106.html).
